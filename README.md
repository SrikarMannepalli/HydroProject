# HydroProject
Calculated PET and AET using different methods from formulae given in slides assuming data presence.  </br>
Attached gui.py is the gui code of last assignment. Attaching here as it will be useful. </br>
Please download and have a look at the tool that we have presented in the slides. If we can replicate that to some extent, it will be good.</br>
The below package could be used for calculating drought indices.</br>

### Package installation
pip install climate-indices

### Running code
python3 main.py
